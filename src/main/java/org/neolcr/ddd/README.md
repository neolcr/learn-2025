# DDD Package Guide

Purpose: This folder contains minimal building blocks to illustrate tactical Domain-Driven Design (DDD). These are intentionally lightweight so you can extend them with real domain logic.

## Components Overview
- Entity: Has identity (id) and equality based on that identity.
- ValueObject: Immutable, equality based on its internal value(s). No lifecycle tracking.
- AggregateRoot: Entry point to a consistency boundary (cluster of Entities + ValueObjects). Extends Entity. (Currently only a placeholder for domain events list.)
- Repository<T>: Abstraction hiding persistence of Aggregates (add/find/delete). Works only with AggregateRoot types.
- DomainService: Stateless domain logic that does not naturally belong to a single Entity/ValueObject (pure domain operations).
- ApplicationService: Orchestrates a use case: load aggregate(s) via repositories, call domain methods, persist, publish events, manage transactions.
- DomainEvent: Immutable record of something that happened in the domain (with occurredOn timestamp).

## Typical Flow (Use Case Execution)
1. External input (API / CLI / Message) calls an ApplicationService.
2. ApplicationService retrieves the Aggregate via Repository.
3. ApplicationService invokes a method on the AggregateRoot (domain behavior) or a DomainService (if behavior spans multiple aggregates).
4. Aggregate enforces invariants and (optionally) records DomainEvents internally.
5. ApplicationService persists changes through Repository.
6. ApplicationService collects & publishes DomainEvents (event bus not yet implemented here).
7. Subscribers react (side effects, projections, integrations) â€“ to be added if needed.

Sequence (simplified):
User -> ApplicationService -> Repository.find -> AggregateRoot.method -> (DomainEvent recorded) -> Repository.save -> Event Publication

## Responsibilities Boundaries
| Concern | Belongs In | Not In |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Invariant enforcement | AggregateRoot / Entities | ApplicationService |
| Pure calculations (stateless) | DomainService / ValueObject | ApplicationService |
| Orchestration / transaction | ApplicationService | Entities |
| Persistence mechanics | Repository impl (infra layer, not shown) | Domain model |
| Event creation | AggregateRoot | ApplicationService (except dispatching) |

## Designing an Aggregate (Guidelines)
1. Identify invariant that must be atomically consistent (this gives you the boundary).
2. Make only the AggregateRoot referenceable from outside; internal Entities referenced only through root.
3. Keep methods intention-revealing; prefer behaviors (e.g., placeOrder()) over CRUD-style setters.
4. Emit DomainEvents only after state changes that matter to other parts of the system.
5. Provide a method (e.g., pullDomainEvents()) to release and clear pending events after persistence.

## Suggested Enhancements (Next Steps)
- Add domainEvents list to AggregateRoot: List<DomainEvent> pendingEvents.
- Methods: protected void addDomainEvent(DomainEvent e); public List<DomainEvent> pullDomainEvents().
- Implement InMemoryRepository<T> using Map<Long,T> for quick prototyping.
- Create a simple EventBus interface + InMemoryEventBus.
- Provide a concrete Aggregate (e.g., Order) with ValueObjects (Money, ProductId) and an OrderPlacedEvent.

## Example Sketch (Pseudo-Structure)
AggregateRoot (Order)
  - orderLines: List<OrderLine>
  - addLine(ProductId, Quantity) -> validates -> mutates -> addDomainEvent(new LineAddedEvent(...))

ApplicationService (PlaceOrderService)
  - load draft Order
  - call order.confirm()
  - repository.save(order)
  - publish(order.pullDomainEvents())

Event Handler (Projection / Integration)
  - on OrderPlacedEvent -> update read model or notify external system

## Value Objects Motivation
Use a ValueObject instead of primitive types to:
- Encapsulate validation (e.g., NonEmptyString, Money)
- Centralize formatting/parsing
- Make illegal states unrepresentable

## When to Use a DomainService
Use only if:
- Operation spans multiple aggregates
- Operation is domain-significant (not purely technical)
- Behavior does not naturally belong to a single aggregate

Keep them thin; if it starts holding state, reconsider design.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Anemic aggregate (only getters/setters, logic in ApplicationService)
- Sprinkling persistence logic in Entities
- Exposing internal Entities outside aggregate boundary
- Letting ApplicationService assemble DomainEvents manually (root should own that)

## Testing Strategy (Outline)
- ValueObject: equality, validation rules
- AggregateRoot: invariants, state transitions, event emission
- ApplicationService: orchestration (mock repository + event publisher)
- DomainService: pure function style tests

## Extending This Folder
Add subpackages if complexity grows:
- org.neolcr.ddd.order
- org.neolcr.ddd.shared (shared kernel ValueObjects)

Keep truly shared items small; avoid creating a dumping ground.

This README focuses on conceptual clarity over completeness. Extend incrementally while preserving boundaries.
