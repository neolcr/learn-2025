 * Domain-Driven Design emphasizes collaboration between technical and domain experts
 * to create a shared understanding of the problem domain and to design software that
 * accurately reflects that domain.

// Additional DDD components would be defined in their respective files within this package.
// For example:
// - Entity classes representing core business objects with unique identities.
// - Value Object classes representing immutable objects that describe certain aspects of the domain.
// - Aggregate classes that group related entities and value objects.
// - Repository interfaces for accessing and persisting aggregates.
// - Domain services encapsulating business logic that doesn't naturally fit within entities or value objects.
// - Application services coordinating tasks and managing transactions.
// - Domain events representing significant occurrences within the domain.
